\title{Extract all features used in a decision tree}
\usage{
get_all_features_from_tree(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A decision tree object where each node may contain:
\itemize{
  \item \code{is_leaf} – logical; \code{TRUE} if the node is a leaf.
  \item \code{features} – character vector of feature names used at that node.
  \item \code{left}, \code{right} – optional child node objects.
}}
}
\value{
A character vector containing all unique feature names used in the tree.
}
\description{
Recursively collects all unique feature names used across a decision tree.
This function is typically used to support tree interpretation and feature
analysis tasks.
}
\examples{
tree <- list(
  is_leaf = FALSE,
  features = c("x1"),
  left = list(is_leaf = TRUE, features = "x2"),
  right = list(is_leaf = TRUE, features = "x3")
)
