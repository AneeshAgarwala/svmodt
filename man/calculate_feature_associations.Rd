\title{Calculate feature associations with a response variable}
\usage{
calculate_feature_associations(data, response, predictors)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the response and predictor variables.}

\item{response}{A string specifying the response variable name.}

\item{predictors}{A character vector of predictor names to evaluate.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of association values (0 to 1) for each predictor.
}
\description{
Computes the association strength between each predictor and the response variable.
For numeric predictors, the absolute Pearson correlation is used. For categorical
predictors, association is estimated using an ANOVA-based pseudo-\eqn{R^2} measure.
}
\details{
- **Numeric predictors:** Computed using the absolute Pearson correlation.
- **Categorical predictors:** Uses the square root of the ratio of between-group
  sum of squares to total sum of squares from an ANOVA model.
