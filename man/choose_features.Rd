\title{Select a subset of features based on correlation, mutual information, or randomness}
\usage{
choose_features(
  data,
  response,
  max_features,
  method = c("random", "mutual", "cor")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the response and predictor variables.}

\item{response}{A string specifying the response variable name.}

\item{max_features}{Integer specifying the maximum number of features to select.}

\item{method}{Selection strategy. One of:
\itemize{
  \item \code{"random"} – randomly selects features.
  \item \code{"mutual"} – ranks features by mutual information with the response
    (requires \pkg{FSelectorRcpp}).
  \item \code{"cor"} – ranks features by absolute correlation with the response.
}}
}
\value{
A character vector of selected feature names.
}
\description{
Chooses up to a specified number of features from a dataset using one of three methods:
random sampling, correlation with the response, or mutual information ranking.
}
\details{
- If the number of predictors is less than or equal to \code{max_features}, all are returned.
- If \code{method = "mutual"} and \pkg{FSelectorRcpp} is not installed or fails,
  the function gracefully falls back to the correlation-based method.
- The correlation method internally calls
  \code{\link{calculate_feature_associations}}.

df <- data.frame(

  x1 = rnorm(100),
  x2 = runif(100),
