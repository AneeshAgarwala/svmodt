\title{Calculate class weights for a node}
\usage{
calculate_node_class_weights(
  y,
  class_weights = "none",
  custom_class_weights = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector of class labels at the current node.}

\item{class_weights}{Character string specifying the weighting strategy.
Options are:
\itemize{
  \item `"none"` – no weighting (default).
  \item `"balanced"` – weights inversely proportional to class frequencies.
  \item `"balanced_subsample"` – weights adjusted to balance each subsample.
  \item `"custom"` – user-provided custom weights.
}}

\item{custom_class_weights}{Named numeric vector of custom class weights
(used only if `class_weights = "custom"`). Names must match the unique
class labels in `y`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; if `TRUE`, prints detailed information about
computed weights.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of class weights for each unique class in `y`,
  or `NULL` if equal weights are used (`class_weights = "none"`) or if the
  custom weights are invalid.
}
\description{
Computes class weights for a given set of target values based on the chosen
weighting strategy. Supports unweighted, balanced, balanced subsample, and
custom weighting schemes, with optional verbosity for diagnostic output.
}
\details{
The function caps computed class weights at 10 to avoid excessively large
scaling factors.
