\title{Calculate Information Gain for a Feature Split}
\usage{
info_gain(feature, target, metric = c("entropy", "gini"))
}
\arguments{
\item{feature}{A vector representing the splitting feature (categorical or factor).}

\item{target}{A vector of class labels for the target variable.}

\item{metric}{The impurity measure to use: either "entropy" or "gini".}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the information gain.
}
\description{
Computes the reduction in impurity (information gain) when splitting a target
variable by a categorical feature.
}
\details{
Information gain is computed as:
\deqn{
  IG = H(parent) - \sum_{v \in Values} \frac{n_v}{n} H(child_v)
}{
  IG = H(parent) - sum_v (n_v / n) * H(child_v)
}
where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{H(parent)} is the impurity of the original target vector,
  \item \eqn{H(child_v)} is the impurity of the subset of target where feature = v,
  \item \eqn{n_v} is the number of samples where feature = v,
  \item \eqn{n} is the total number of samples.
}
