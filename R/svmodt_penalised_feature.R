#' @title Select features with optional penalty for previously used features
#' @description
#' Internal helper function to select a subset of features while optionally penalizing
#' features that have been used in ancestor nodes. Supports random selection,
#' mutual information, or correlation-based ranking.
#'
#' @param data A data frame containing predictors and the response.
#' @param response Name of the response variable.
#' @param max_features Maximum number of features to select.
#' @param method Feature selection method; one of \code{"random"}, \code{"mutual"}, or \code{"cor"}.
#' @param penalize_used Logical; if \code{TRUE}, previously used features are penalized.
#' @param penalty_weight Numeric (0â€“0.99); fraction by which to reduce the score/weight of used features.
#' @param used_features Character vector of features previously used in the tree.
#' @param verbose Logical; if \code{TRUE}, prints information about penalties applied.
#'
#' @return Character vector of selected feature names.
#'
#' @details
#' - Penalized features have their selection weight or score reduced by multiplying by \code{(1 - penalty_weight)}.
#' - For \code{method = "random"}, the penalty reduces the probability of sampling a feature.
#' - For \code{method = "mutual"} or \code{"cor"}, the penalty reduces feature importance or correlation.
#' - If no valid features are available for correlation, the function falls back to random selection with penalty.
#' - Ensures that no feature is entirely excluded; \code{penalty_weight} is capped below 1.
