Description: Implements Support Vector Machine Oblique Decision Trees (SVMODT), a hybrid 
    classifier combining decision tree interpretability with Support Vector Machine 
    robustness. Recursively builds classification trees using linear SVM hyperplanes 
    at each node instead of axis-parallel splits, creating oblique decision boundaries 
    that better capture complex patterns. Features include multiple feature selection 
    methods (random, mutual information, correlation-based), dynamic feature subset 
    strategies, class weight support for imbalanced datasets, node-specific feature 
    scaling.
